Title : Making app interactive

1) Button:
Button is any graphical element that provides the user a simple way to interact or trigger an event.

2) Button widget in flutter
There are so many types of buttons avaiable in flutter such as:
Text Button, Elevated Button, Outlined Button.

3) How to add elevated button?
ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: function,
    child: Any widget,
)
this is the required syntax to add elevated button.

4) How to add outlined button?
OutlinedButton(
    onPressed: function,
    child: Any widget,
)
this is the required syntax to add elevated button.

5) What is stateful widget?
a widget that has a mutable state.

6) setState()
it is basically used to rebuild the widgets.(it calls build method with new values of state)
it takes one argument which must be a function.

7) how to add checkbox?
To add a checkbox we can use CheckBox() widget
CheckBox(
      value: isCheck,
      onChanged: (value) {
        isCheck = value!;
        setState(() {
        });
      },
    ),

value is a property that takes either true or flase.
(here isCheck is a variable of boolean datatype.)
onChanged property accepts a function.
(that function takes one bool type argument)

8) Note taking app
an application to take note of something important.
Features:
    Add notes
    View notes
    Edit notes
    Delete notes
    Search notes

9) In notes app we saw the following:

different files for different pages.

backgroundColor:
  property of AppBar()
  backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor,

Container()
  it takes one required argument "child: any widget"

TextField()
  A text field lets the user enter text, either with hardware keyboard or with an onscreen keyboard.
  it calls the onChanged callback whenever the user changes the text in the field.
  To control the text that is displayed in the text field, use the controller.
  You can use the decoration property to control the decoration.
  TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
      hintText: "search notes",
      prefixIcon: Icon(Icons.search),
      border: InputBorder.none,
    ),
  ),

Padding()

decoration: BoxDecoration(
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5.0),
  color: Colors.grey[200],
)
